# InternationalMC

InternationalMC (originally created on February 17, 2025 and renamed) was Minecraft plugin development project that was created specifically for plugin called "Valentines" and more plugins were added as the development continued. 
On April 20, 2025 "Valentines" got ~2100 downloads together on all platforms (Hangar, Modrinth, Spigot and Github). In months May - July, this project was very unstable because of summer holidays and many pages redesigns but on August 20, 2025 when it was again "started", it had different name "InternationalMC" and stable website where only bug fixes and small changes were added.
Because of ban on SpigotMC, all plugins were only on Modrinth and on October 3, 2025 project was ended and on October 4, deleted, because of low statistics.

As far as I know, in January/February 2026, there may be Valentines plugin somewhere but not from me. So just a reminder: *SoneMC/InternationalMC Valentines plugin was the first plugin for this specific day after years. Last Valentines plugin I saw was in 2015-2017. So if someone wants to remake Valentines for 2026 year, please do not copy this plugin (from images & description).*

Thanks for support.
